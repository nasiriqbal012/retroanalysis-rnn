# retroanalysis-rnn
The code has two scripts. 
First script will convert product SMILE formats to graphs. To run this script, we need PySmile, NumPy, NetworkX and Pickle packages. When you will run this script, it will ask to enter the names/addresses of input and output files for train, test and validation dataset. 
When you will run the second script it will ask to enter the names/addresses of files generated by previous script (Graphical data for train, test and validation). This script will perform following functions:
- Normalize the data
- Compute weights for all classes
- Artificially synthesize the data for minority classes 
- Encode the labels by OneHotEncoder
- Training, testing and validation of model

To run this script, we need sklearn, keras, tensorflow, matplotlib, imblearn and collections packages and frameworks.
